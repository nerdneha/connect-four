connect-four
============

I made this app using Pygame for fun to explore the visual-meets-code aspect of Pygame and program an AI for my first time. Honestly I just wanted to relive my favorite childhood game and play with it for fun. 

####To start the app:
    python connect-four.py

The app allows you to play a two-player game or a game against the computer; the computer option has easy, medium, or hard levels. These levels are as follows:
* Easy: A random column is chosen by the computer
* Medium/Hard: A column is chosen by the computer based on a minimax algorithm; to conserve time, the algorithm is limited by depth. The depth limit is 3 for medium and 5 for hard. 

The playing screens look like the following:
